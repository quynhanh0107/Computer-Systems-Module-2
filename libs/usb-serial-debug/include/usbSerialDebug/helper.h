 * blocking forever. Do not call them from ISRs or TinyUSB callbacks.

 * @note You must run TinyUSB in a task (e.g., a task that calls tud_task()).

 * @brief Thread-safe print of a null-terminated string to CDC0.

 * block indefinitely: it uses a mutex and a short TX-space wait inside.

 * @param s Pointer to a null-terminated C string. Must not be @c NULL.
 *
 * @return Number of bytes written (>= 0). Returns 0 if CDC0 is not ready
 *         (device not mounted or port not opened) or if a timeout occurred.
 *         Returns -1 if @p s is @c NULL.
 *
 * @note Do not call from ISRs or TinyUSB callbacks; enqueue to a logger task instead.
 * @note If multiple tasks call this function, output is serialized by the mutex.
 * @note This writes to CDC0; keep CDC1 free for your application data if you use dual CDC.
